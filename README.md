The 2020-2021 school year will look different for everyone in college this year. Some will find themselves conducting classes and events in person, while others have gone completely virtual in favor of student safety. However, the majority of campuses have promised a hybrid version where classes necessary to have in person are done so. But where does this leave clubs? Looking at club turnout last spring, the arrival of COVID-19 significantly decreased the number of participants. This is where Club Journey comes in. Club Journey encourages students to visit multiple clubs' meetings to explore and expand their interests, while also benefitting club directors by giving them a universal platform to share information and updates about their virtual meetings. To motivate students to attend, we've designed a passport-like system where students can earn stamps as they participate in more club meetings and compete with friends.
